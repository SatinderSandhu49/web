									<h1>GREETINGS</h1>

									<h3>Respected Sir/Ma'am,</h3>
									<p>I came to Canada last year after having finished my Bachelor's in Technology of Mechanical Engineering from India. </p>
								</header>
									<header>
										<h3>Startup during College </h3>
										<p>Right after graduating, the startup I was selected for incubation by Startup Chile. (https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/chandigarh/pec-start-up-wins-rs10-lakh-458951) I was developing Automated Hydroponic Systems and the startup was built around selling hydroponic systems and hydroponic produce. </p>
									</header>
									<header>
										<h3>Sales Experience</h3>
										<p>After having completed the program at Startup Chile, I went back to India and joined the leading EdTech Startup of India, "Byjus". I joined in a Business Development role, primarily to understand what I could have done better in terms of business during my time in Chile. While working at Byjus I was a constant performer, topping in multiple cycles.

											After having gotten a keen grasp of Business Fundamentals and sales pitches, I joined ClickLabs, a software development company based around selling customized software solutions for small and medium businesses. I joined in a Sales role and was given the responsibility of setting up the sales model for a new project. The project was a Tech BootCamp School and I personally registered over 200 students in 6 months.	</header>
										<header>
										<h3>Canada and the Future</h3>
										<p>I had applied for migration to Canada after graduating and by this time my papers came through and I migrated here to further my career.

											After having come here, I have been working construction in a temporary role while polishing my coding skills. I already had some programming experience from building Automated Hydroponic Systems. 
											
											Since the past year I have been learning mobile and website development and have reached reasonable proficiency.	</header>
